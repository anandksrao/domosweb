        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <a name="introduction"></a>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Most proteins are comprised of smaller (structural) modules - <em>protein domains</em>
            The evolution of proteins involves the re-arrangement, loss or gain of protein domains
            in a process referred to as modular evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            DoMosaics is a tool for analysing and visualizing aspects of modular protein evolution.
            It allows users to, starting with a set of related protein sequences, annotate protein domains
            (using different domain annotation methods), and visualize <em>domain arrangements</em>
            (the N- to C-terminal order of domains in a protein) along a phylogentic tree.
            It can be used to find out whether a domain of
            interest was lost, whether a group of proteins differs in its domain arrangements, or what the characteristic
            domains for a phylogenetic group are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond domain annotation, DoMosaics allows users to examine domain annotations
            to see whether the domains have been correctly identified. You can create dotplots, run a context-dependent
            similarity analysis and more. Furthermore, you can also run some general phylogenetic profiling,
            create domain network graphs, find domain insertion/deletion events or simply visualize and
            manipulate phylogenetic trees.
            All output can be saved as PDF or as SVG (which can be viewed in Firefox or edited using e.g.
            Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape) as well as in a number of common bitmap formats.
        </p>

    <div class='section' style='margin-top: 40px; text-align: justify;'>
        <h3>2. Installation</h3>
        <a name="installation"></a>
        <hr>
        <h4>Prerequists</h4>
        <a name="prereq"></a>
        <p>
            DoMosaics requires a working Java installation. Furthermore, we recommend that users who plan to run
            local HMMSCAN jobs have a least a dual-core system. You can find the appropriate Java
            version for your system here:
            <a href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a>
            If you plan to run HMMSCAN you will further more require the HMMER package, which you can obtain from here:
            <a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/software">http://hmmer.janelia.org/software</a>
        </p>
        <br>


        <h4>Installing DoMosaics</h4>
        <a name="install"></a>
        <p>
        To get DoMosaics, navigate to the website <a href="http://www.domosaics.net">www.domosaics.net</a>, and go to the download
        section. Here, you can run DoMosaics using <a href="">Java Web Start</a>. In order to do so, you must select the
        <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr> size (e.g. 500MB), and press 'Start DoMosaics'.
        Your browser will download a <abbr title="Java Network Launcher Protocol">JNLP</abbr> file and ask for you to confirm
        the security exception. <b>Note</b> that DoMosaics will require full permission to your system in order to interact
        with processes, write files etc. Once you confirm the security settings, the program should start.
        If you prefer, you can also Download the jar and run it manually (or compile the program from source). Choose the
        tab 'Direct Download' to get the binaries and source files.
        </p>
        <p>
        If your browser does not autostart the jar file after download, it is likely that your browser is not set up to
        handle JNLP files. If so, when you start DoMosaics you will see a dialog asking you what to do with the file.
        In the window, click on Open with, select the javaws executable (depending on your operating system, the name can
        be different) and press OK. If the "open with" option does not display the Java Web Start executable,
        map the .jnlp file to Java Web Start manually. This procedure differs for different browsers - best google
        the right solution for your OS/Browser setup.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Using the java archive (jar)</h4>
        <a name="useJar"></a>
        As mentioned above, as an alternatively you can run the DoMosaics java archive directly.
        To download the archive, follow the download link from the sign-up email, and choose
        'Get jar file'. If you do not wish to sign-up, go to the download section mentioned above and
        select 'Direct Download' from the tab.
        On *unix systems, you can run the Java archive as follows:
        <pre>[12:59] radmoore@joshua ~/Download $ java -jar domosaics.jar</pre>
        Users of other systems should be able to double-click the jar file.

        <hr>
        <h4>Working Directory</h4>
        <a name="wdir"></a>
            When DoMosaics starts, you will be required to select a working directory. The workspace
            (which includes all project data) will be saved in this directory.
            By default, the working directory will be under ${user_home}/domosaics-workspace. The main window consists of:
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>the main menu and button bar on the top,</li>
                <li>the workspace with all projects on the left,</li>
                <li>and the main view on the right.</li>

        <div class='row'>
            <div class='span8'>
                To make it easier to get started, DoMosaics comes with an example dataset.
                Open the example dataset by selecting "Help" from the main menu, and then choosing
                "Load example project". For a walk through the small example dataset, have a look at the
                <a href="#exampleProject">example project</a> section. Once you have familiarized yourself
                with the basics of the interface, find out more about how to load
                your own data set under the <a href="#loadData">load data</a> section.

            InterPro (read section <a href="#interproscan">Interproscan</a> below) can be used to find domains in a set of protein
            sequences. This service is offered by the <abbr title="European Bioinformatics Institute">EBI</abbr>.
            In order to use this free public service, users must provide a valid email address. While an email address can be
            provided in the user interface of interproscan and for each scan separately, it will be lost as soon as the dialog
            is closed. Users can provide a global email address here, which will be pre-filled in the interproscan form.
        </p>
        <p class="label label-important">Note</p> the email address provided <b>is used for interproscan only</b>.

        <br>

        <b>Local HMMER3 Setup</b><br>
        <p>
            If you use a local HMMER installation, you can pre-define the binaries and profiles you use for scanning
            here. For more information on what these fields mean (and what they are good for), consult
            the section on <a href="#hmmscan">Hmmscan</a> below.
        </p>

        <b>Workspace</b><br>
        <p>
            DoMosaics project data are saved in folders, with all relevant data saved in xml files. The project folders are
            saved in a user-defined workspace folder (typically $user_home/domosaics-workspace).
            If DoMosaics does not have a workspace folder set upon start up, users are prompted to enter one. The
            workspace folder can be changed any time here.
        </p>
        <p>Users are prompted whether the workspace is to be synchronized upon exit (in which any changes made to existing projects,
        as well as any new projects will be written to the workspace folder). This can be set as default by selecting the check-box
        'Save Workspace on Exit'. If a project should already exist it can be overwritten (users will normally be prompted whether
        existing project files are to be overwritten). This too can be set as default.</p>

        <b>Help improve</b><br>
        <p>
        Should any errors occur while using DoMosaics, a simple error reports can be submitted to a dedicated <a href="http://iebservices.uni-muenster.de/bugzilla">bugzilla</a>
        instance. By agreeing to 'Help improve DoMosaics' we are made aware of any Java <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling">exceptions</a>
        which might occur while using DoMosaics.<br>
        Submitted error reports <b>do not contain any information on data used</b>. However, they do contain a dump of the current users environment which
        often contains the username of the current user as well as directory names and paths (along with other, purely machine-based information).
        The bug reports are used for the sole purpose of simplifying the reconstruction of the error (so that it can be fixed).
        <b>We greatly appreciate your help in eradicating any errors which may occur</b>.

    <div class='section' style='margin-top: 40px; text-align: justify;'>
        <h3>4. Loading Data</h3>
        <a name="loadData"></a>
        <hr>
        There are three data types used within DoMosaics:
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Trees</li>
                <li>Sequences</li>
                <li>Domains (arrangements)</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        These three types are separately loaded into a project (via File, Manage Projects). DoMosaics supports the following file formats:
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format">Newick</a> for trees</li>

        <div class='row'>
            <div class='span8'>
                <b>The best way to start with DoMosaics, is to load a file with fasta entries into a new project</b>
                Domain annotation data can be obtained from within DoMosaics (see section <a href="#domainAnnotation">Domain Annotation</a>).
                Trees are best created (from the same fasta file in which domains were annotated) using a
                proper tree creation program (such as <a href="https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML">RaxML</a>,
                <a href="http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/">FastTree</a> or  <a href="http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/">PhyML</a>),
                however DoMosaics can create trees from input sequences (see section <a href="#trees">trees</a>) to get started.
            </div>
            <div class="span4">
                <div class="alert">

        <h4>Seqeuence data</h4>
        <hr>
        <a name="sequenceData"></a>
        To load fasta files into DoMosaics, go to File, Manage Projects. Create a new project or
        select an existing project from the menu. Click on 'next'. Select the data type 'Sequence'
        and navigate to your fasta file. To associate the sequences with an existing domain-view,
        select a view from the drop down. Note that the sequences are matched with the domain
        arrangements of the domain view via their ID.<br>
        For example, this sequence

<pre>
>P82176
MKCLLYLCLWCYCVLVSSSIVLICNGGHEYYECGGACDNVCADLHIQNKTNCPIINIRCN
DKCYCEDGYARDVNGKCIPIKDCPKIRSRRSIGIPVDKKCCTGPNEHYDEEKVSCPPETC
ISLVAKFSCIDSPPPSPGCSCNSGYLRLNLTSPCIPICDCPQMQHSPDCQ
</pre>
        would match with a protein in the domain view named P82176. <b>Everything between the '>' and the first white space
        is treated as the ID</b>.
        <br>
        <br>

        <h4>Domain Arrangements</h4>
        <hr>
        <a name="domainData"></a>
        <div class='row'>
            <div class='span8'>
                As mentioned above, domains can be annotated from within DoMosaics (see section Domain Annotation).
                Domain annotation data can be loaded into a new or existing project.
                Currently, the following formats are supported:
            </div>
            <div class="span4">
                <div class="alert">
                    <b>Objective</b>: Load domain data<br>
                    Main Menu, File, Manage Projects, new Project, next, Arrangement
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <b>1. </b>XDOM-format<br>
        We recommend using the xdom format. It is the generic IO format which is an easy to
        read, fasta-like representation of a protein with its constituent domains. For example,
        the human protein ENSP00000376776 is represented in xdom format as:
<pre>
>ENSP00000376776  617
57  171 DOMON 2.0e-25
213 341 Cu2_monooxygen  7.5e-43
360 521 Cu2_monoox_C  2.3e-52
</pre>

        ENSP00000376776 consists of three domains (DOMON, Cu2_monooxygen, Cu2_monoox_C) and has a sequence length of
        617. In the xdom format, domains are sorted in N- to C terminal order.
        Each domain line contains the start and stop position, some form of ID or accession number and an Evalue.

        <b>2. </b>HMMSCAN output<br>
        <a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org">HMMER</a> is a suite of powerful tools for applying hidden Markov models
        (HMMs) to biological sequence data. HMMER is used to create Pfam HMMs. HMMSCAN is a program from the
        HMMER package, and is used to search protein sequences against a collection of HMMs.
        Using HMMSCAN, users can annotate known domains in a given sequence.
        DoMosaics can import domain annotation produced by using hmmscan with the <code>--domtblout</code> option.
        <br><br>
        HMMSCAN can be run from within DoMosaics (see section <a href="#domainAnnotation">Domain annotation</a>). If you would like to run
        hmmscan from the command line, consult the excellent HMMER manual which can be found at
        <a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org">http://hmmer.janelia.org</a>
        Note also that the HMMI also has a very nice web interface to hmmscan (and a couple of other programs
        from the HMMER package).

                DoMosaics reads tree which are formatted according to the Newick format description.
                As with matching sequence and domain data, tree leaves (typically protein IDs) are
                associated with proteins via the label of the leaf. Trees are best created using dedicated
                software (such as RaxML or FastTree, see above).

        <h3>5. Domain Annotation</h3>
        <hr>
        DoMosaics provides two distinct ways to annotate domains in protein sequences.
        <a name="interpro"></a>
        <h4>InterPro</h4>
        The first method,
        InterProScan is a webservice provided by the <abbr title="European Bioinformatics Institute">IEB</abbr> (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/</a>).
        DoMosaics provides a graphical client for performing domain annotation with interproscan. <b>This is the simplest method for
        annotating domains</b> in protein sequences, however it <b>can not be meaningfully applied to a large dataset</b>.

        <br>

        <a name="hmmer"></a>
        <h4>HMMER</h4>
        For larger datasets, and to have more control over the annotation process, a local hmmscan installation is
        the most meaningful strategy. As mentioned above, hmmscan is part of the HMMER package. DoMosaics provides
        a simple graphical frontend to a local installation of hmmscan. Find out more on conducting a local
        hmmscan search <a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/software">here</a>.

        <h4>InterPro</h4>
        <hr>
        <a name="interproscan"></a>
        <p class='label label-important'>Note</p> Running an interproscan search requires a working internet connection.
        <br><br>
        As mentioned in the last section, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) offers a service, interproscan,
        by which protein sequences can be submitted to their systems for domain annotation.
        Currently, 17 domain databases are supported by interproscan, 10 of which can be used from within DoMosaics.
        For more information on interproscan, visit their website at
        <a href='http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/about.html'>http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/about.html</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="text-success"><b>Advantage</b></p>
        <div class="well">
        The advantages of running interproscan are the large number of supported domain definitions, the fact that
        no installation is required, that domain definition models must not be obtained or processes and
        that, at least for some of the supported databases, the Gene Ontology annotation of domain hits is
        returned along with the domain information.
        </div>

        <p class="text-error"><b>Disadvantages</b></p>
        <div class="well">
        The disadvantages are that, as the resource is public and over the internet, only few sequences can be
        annotated within a reasonable time frame (roughly XXX in 10 minutes). Furthermore, the user has no control
        over the detection thresholds (which can for example be useful for running context-dependant annotation).

        <a name="hmmscan"></a>
        <p>
            Hmmscan is a program from the HMMER package. It is used to search protein sequences
            against a database of hidden Markov models (HMM) profiles, such as those created stored in
            <a href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk">Pfam</a>. HMMSCAN is used to detect the presence of domains in proteins.
        <p class="label label-important">Note</p> you can set default values for the binaries and profiles

                Both Hmmscan and Hmmpress binaries can be downloaded as part of an archive from
                http://hmmer.janelia.org. Once downloaded, extract the archive and look for the 'binaries'
                folder. In there, you should find the required binaries (Hmmscan and Hmmpress).
                If you cannot find an archive for your OS, or the binaries do not work, you will have to compile
                from source - please check the HMMER manual on instructions how to do so.
                </p>

                <b>HMMER3 scan bin</b><br>
                As mentioned above, Hmmscan is used to search protein sequences against a collection of HMMs.
                It computes scores (and E-values which reflect the significance of scores) which measures the
                similarity between a query sequence and each model of the HMM library. Choose the hmmscan binaries
                which can be found in the binaries folder mentioned above.
                <br><br>

                <b>HMMER3 press bin</b><br>
                Hmmpress is used to index the HMM library (which allows for swift searches,
                much like formatdb for BLAST). DoMosaics will automatically detect if your HMM
                library is pressed or not (and will press HMM library should the binary be available).
                Choose the hmmpress binaries which can be found in the binaries folder mentioned above.
                <br><br>

            </div>
        </div>
        <b>Profiles</b><br>
        Once the Hmmscan and Hmmpress binaries have been loaded, you must select the file
        containing the HMM profiles. It must be HMMER3 formatted.
        For example, Pfam-A profiles can be obtained from the Pfam FTP server under
        <a href="ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/Pfam-A.hmm.gz">ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/Pfam-A.hmm.gz</a>
        For more information on the profiles, and how you can create your own, consult the HMMER manual.<br>
        <p class="label label-info">Note</p> that you can conduct searches and construct profiles
        on the <a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/">HMMER website</a>.
        <br><br>

        <b>Query sequences</b><br>
        Query Sequences
        You can either load a fasta from disk, or select a sequence view (should you have previously <a href="#loadData">loaded sequence data into a project</a>).
        <br><br>
        <b>Options</b><br>
        <p>
        To assert the presence of a domain in a protein, <b>thresholds</b> are generally used to minimize the number of false positives.
        The threshold can be either manually curated for each domain model (see the HMMER manual for a description of the gathering threshold)
        or automatically set to an E-value (confidence) cut-off for all models. In DoMosaics, if the confidence cutoff is selected,
        the per-model gathering threshold will be used. Otherwise, a global E-value cut-off can be entered.
        Filters
        </p>
        <p>
        HMMER3 applies a number of <b>filters</b> which amount to a drastic increase in speed. However, the downside of these
        filers is that false positives can be expected (domains wrongly discarded by filters). HMMER, and DoMosaics, provides the option to turn
        off some of the filters. The "bias filter" is for biased amino-acid composition (low-complexity) and the
        "max filter" deactivates all filters (at the cost of much longer running times).
        <p>
        The Number of CPUs specifies on how many CPUs the scan will be performed.
        </p>

        <b>Post processing</b><br>
        <p>
        Hmmscan returns a list of all domain occurrences detected in a protein, which might contain <b>overlaps</b>.
        This frequently occurs with homolog domain families (specialization of an ancestral domain).
        DoMosaics has different methods for dealing with overlaps:
        <ul>
            <li>it can keep overlapping domains, which can be resolved later by manually curation</li>
            <li>it can resolve overlaps based on "E-value" which is the standard approach used in Pfam or InterPro</li>
            <li>it can remove overlapping domains according to a "maximum-coverage" approach</li>
        </ul>
        The latter puts larger emphasis on reducing the number of unassigned residues rather than accounting for
        statistical significance; this is generally not advisable.
       </p>
       <p>
       As part of the post processing of domain annotation, DoMosaics allows for context-dependant annotation as a mean
       to provide more complete domain annotation. The objective of context-dependant annotation is to detect
       remote/divergent but relevant additional domains by using similar arrangements to find possibly missed annotation.
       <br>
       Confidence thresholds are to guarantee the (quasi-)absence of false positives. However, such
       stringent policy leads to numerous missed domains, especially in remote or divergent species.
       This can be dealt with by lowering detection threshold. However, this comes at the cost of exponential number of false positives.
       The <b>Co-Occurring Domain Detection</b> (CODD) approach (described in Terrapon et al., Bioinformatics, 2009)
       exploits the tendency of domain families to appear with a highly
       reduced set of "collaborating" other families. It filters the false positives to only retain the most trust-worthy
       domains that barely escape from recommended (pre-defined) thresholds.
       </p>

     <h4>Rapid Alignment of Domain Strings</h4>
        <a name="rads"></a>
        <hr>
        RADS (<b>R</b>apid <b>A</b>lignment of <b>D</b>omain <b>S</b>trings) is a search algorithm for finding similar domain arrangements
        to a given query. RADS employs a dynamic programming approach to align domains of two arrangements. It
        does not perform sequence comparison, and instead assumes that regions of two proteins which share a
        domains have a similar sequence. RADS is complimented by RAMPAGE (Rapid Alignment Method of Proteins based on
        domain ArranGEments), which aligns regions (domains and interdomainic) based on RADS results.
        RAMPAGE preforms a global alignment of the sequences which correspond to these regions, and provides
        increased sensitivity over RADS (in particular when comparing identical arrangements)

        <p>For more information on RADS, visit <a href="http://rads.uni-muenster.de">http://rads.uni-muenster.de</a></p>

        DoMosaics provides an interface to the RADS web service, and allows users to find arrangements in UniProt which
        are similar to a given query. There are two distinct ways of accessing the RADS interface from within DoMosaics:

        <ul>
            <li>via the main menu, Actions, RADS (or via the button bar with the rat logo)</li>
            <li>via the context menu of an arrangement (right click on an arrangement, RadsScan this arrangement - see image below)</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="img/rads.png">

        <p class="label label-important">Note</p> It is important to note that<br>
        <ol>
            <li>the RADS/RAMPAGE webservice is Pfam-based (that is, it will only find arrangements with Pfam IDs)</li>
            <li>scans can only be performed using a single query sequence</li>
        </ol>

        <b>Loading a sequence</b><br>
        <p>
        You can load a fasta entry from a file, or load an existing sequence view. If this route is chosen, the sequences are
        first annotated (remotely, via the RADS webservice) using the Pfam domain definitions. After this step,
        the resulting arrangement is used as a query to find similar arrangements in UniProt.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note that if your file or view contains multiple entries, only a single entry will be chosen for the scan.
        While for a file with multiple fasta entries the first entry will be chosen, using a sequence views with
        multiple entries results in the use of any sequence from the view (as the entries in a sequence view are not ordered).
        In other words, using a view to search only makes sense if you know all arrangements are the same
        (or if you expect them to be very similar, such as could be the case for a set of orthologous proteins).
        <p>
        <b>Loading a domain arrangement</b><br>
        <p>
        You can also load a domain arrangement (in xdom format) from a file. As with sequences, only one entry will be
        chosen from the file (the first); if a domain-view is chosen, the selection will be (as for sequences)
        seemingly random. Again, this only makes sense if the arrangements in the arrangement view are the
        same (or very similar). Furthermore, as the current implementation of RADS/RAMPAGE is based on
        Pfam domain definitions your search will be unsuccessful if you use arrangements with domains other than Pfam.
        If you have arrangements with other domain definitions, consider using the sequence instead.
        </p>

        <b>Choosing a search algorithm</b><br>
        <p>
        Both RADS and RAMPAGE can be used for the search (see above). A RAMPAGE search requires sequences, and implies
        an initial RADS search. In most cases, the score values can remain as is (Set defaults will restore the default
        scores if you should have changed them).
        </p>

        <b>The results table</b><br>
        <p>
        Once the search has completed, Show results will list all hits that were found (ordered by score).
        Some information about the query, including a graphical representation of its arrangements are displayed at
        the top. Select hits of interest by clicking the import checkbox (or use the select all button to import all hits).
        Click on Import selection to import you selection. You can associate the scan hits with an existing project
        from the dropdown menu.

        <p>
            If you do not have sequences associated with the arrangements, you can build a tree based on a distance
            matrix created from differences in the domain arrangements (see using domains for tree creation below).
            Of course, you can select a regular sequence view for tree creation. Note that selecting a sequence view
            will clear any arrangement-views you may have selected.
        </p>

        <b>Creating the tree</b><br>
        <p>
            After selecting the dataset, click 'Next'. Select a substitution matrix from the top dropdown, and choose a
            tree constructing method from the bottom. Click 'Finish', and, once the tree construction is complete,
            give the new tree-view a name (which must be unique) and associate with a project.
            <br>
            Once you have constructed a tree, you might consider creating a domain-tree view.

        <h4>Create a domain-tree</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>A domain tree is a tree with leaves associated to arrangements. It is a central element of DoMosaics, both for the analysis
         of domain arrangements across a protein family, as well as for the visualization of related proteins
         with their domain structure:</p>

        <div class='row'>
            <div class='span8'>
                To create a domain-tree view, you will need a project which has at least a domain-view and a tree view.
                Note that when you create a domain-tree view you will loose the tree and the domain view (as they will be combined into one).
                Open the dialog by clicking on Actions, Trees, Create Domain Tree. Choose an arrangement view and a tree
                view which you wish to merge.
                It is important to realize that the association will only work if the
                labels of the leaves and the IDs of the arrangements are identical
                (see also the section on <a href='#loadData'>loading data</a> for more information).

    <div class="section" style="margin-top: 40px; text-align: justify;">
        <a name="views"></a>
        <h3>7. Views</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Views belong to projects and are displayed in the left-hand side of the workspace.
        Every project can have one of four different view types</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sequence view</li>
            <li>Tree view</li>
            <li>Domain view</li>
            <li>Domain-tree view</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        Each view is associated with its own view panel (main window on the right), and comes with a distinct
        set of functionalities organised in a main menu (at the top of the view panel), and context menus
        available by a mouse right-click on items within the view. Within one project in the workspace,
        each of these four view types is a separate category (node in the tree):</p>
        <img src="img/project-icons.png">
        <p>Note that each of these four types is associated with a specific icon. Domain arrangements that are
        associated with sequences are signified by an additional 's' in the icon. Views can be selected through
        double click. An active view is displayed in the main view panel on the left.</p>
        <p>
            There are a number of functionalities in each view. Here, we will only illustrate some of the features
            specific to DoMosaics. All views provide means for exporting back-end data to files (e.g. sequence view to
            fasta) or to graphics (pixel and vector).
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Sequence view</h4>
        <a name="seqview"></a>
        <p>The sequence view is the simplest of all views.
        Sequence views provide means for the user to maintain the association between a set of sequences and corresponding domain
        annotation or trees. Furthermore, sequence views can be selected wherever sequences are needed (e.g. for domain annotation). They can also
        be created from other views, for example through the use of the 'Select sequence' functionality in the Domain-view (see below).</p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Tree view</h4>
        <a name="treeView"></a>
        <div class="alert alert-danger">
            <b>Note</b>: While trees can be created using DoMosaics, it is not a program for constructing trees. The best approach
            is to use a dedicated phylogenetic program to create a tree (such as <a href="https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML">RaxML</a>,
            <a href="http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/">FastTree</a> or <a href="http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/">PhyML</a>),
            and to then import your tree (as newick) into DoMosaics (see section on <a href="#loadData">importing trees</a>).
        </div>
        <p>When a tree view is open, the main menu (main view panel at the right) will display the tree. A number of tree
        specific options are available under 'View' in the main menu (e.g. expand leaves or show bootstrap values).
        Tree visuals can be adjusted under 'Edit' (e.g. change <b>edge weights</b> or <b>fonts</b>)
        </p>
        <h5>Context menu: Node</h5>
        <p>
           A right mouse on nodes in the tree will show the node context menu, from which a number of operations are available
           such as highlight subtree, rotate children, re-root tree, collapse/expand etc. <b>Note</b> that functionalities
           available in a tree are also available in a domain tree.
        </p>
        <img src="img/node_context.png">
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Domain view</h4>
        <a name="domainView"></a>
        <p>
            The domain view is the most central view in DoMosaics. As with the sequence and tree views, domains views
            have a distinct menu along the top of the main view panel. This menu provides the following functionalities:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>File</dt>
            <dd>

                    <dt>Zoom mode</dt>
                    <dd>When enabled, the current view is treated as a static graphic and allows zoom-in and zoom-out operations.
                        While in this view, no context-operations can be used.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Accession IDs</dt>
                    <dd>When enabled, domain accession IDs are displayed instead of domain names (e.g. PF0001 instead of 7tm_1).
                        If the used domain definition only has one type of identifier there will be no difference between names and accession IDs.
                        For domain names, enable Domain Names.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Proportional view</dt>
                    <dd>
                        When enabled, arrangements are displayed with a scale corresponding to their sequence length.
                        Domains sizes are proportional to their length in the underlying data set. In contrast,
                        when the <b>un-proportional view</b> option is selected every domain has the same size, and domains
                        are displayed with different shapes and colors (both of which can be configured for each distinct family).
                    </dd>
                    <dt>MSA view</dt>
                    <dd>
                        When enabled, proteins are displayed as sequences, and the domains are signified using color-coded
                        boxes. This can be useful for selecting sequence regions of interest (by dragging the mouse over regions
                        of interest and clicking the right mouse button, sequence regions can be saved as new sequence views or fasta
                        files).

                    <dt>Fit to screen</dt>
                    <dd>
                        When enabled, the displayed arrangements are re-sized to fit to the visible screen.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Evalue colorization</dt>
                    <dd>
                        When enabled, the alpha-value of the domain colors is changes in correspondance to
                        the domains evalue. Domains with very high values become transparent, where as
                        domains with very low evalues have strong colors.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Show shapes</dt>
                    <dd>
                        When enabled, domains are displayed as shapes. The domain name is removed and domain families
                        are distinguished through domain shape and color. <b>Note</b> that while the domain colors and
                        shapes will be specific for families <em>within</em> projects, they may differ
                        <em>between</em> projects. Both shapes and colors can be adjusted.
                    </dd>

            DoMosaics allows users to build trees based on domain arrangements, or to filter datasets to only
            include similar
            arrangements. These operations are achieved by using a measurement that describe the distance between
            arrangements.
            Currently, two types of distances are implemented: the (1) domain distance and the (2) Jaccard distance.
            To open the distance matrix go to Tools -> Distance matrix.

        comparing sets, and is computed by dividing the intersection
        of two given sets by their union. Ergo, a Jaccard index of 1 signifies that two given sets are identical.
        The Jaccard distance can be easily computed by subtracting the Jaccard similarity coefficient from 1;
        it moves between 0 and 1. In DoMosaics, the compared sets correspond to domain sets.

    <b>Domain Distance</b><br>

    <p>

        The Domain distance is an edit distance, in which the differences between two strings can be measured as the
        number of operations necessary to transform from one string into the other. Arrangements are strings of a
        proteins constituent domains. As such, two arrangements can be compared using their edit distance,
        using insertions and deletions as operations. A large domain distance indicates that a large number of
        operations are necessary to go from one arrangements to another, and may be indicative of a
        large evolutionary distance between the two considered proteins.
    </p>

    <p>
        The distance matrix provides an overview of the distances between arrangements, whereas users can determine
        which distance is to be used under 'Options'. The IDs/Names of the proteins as they appear in the
        corresponding
        view are found along the axis; choosing a cell in the matrix will highlight the two proteins which are being
        compared.
        The distances can be exported to a .csv file for further processing.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src='img/distance-matrix.png'></p>

    <p>
        Datasets can be filtered by these distance matrices. To do so, select an arrangement
        in a domain or domain-tree view, go to 'Edit' in the submenu and choose 'Collapse by similarity'. For
        example, you can
        filter the dataset by changing the max. allowed number of edit operations using a sliding bar

    <h4>Domain Graph</h4>
    <hr>

    <p class="label label-warning">Heads up!</p> The domain graph functionality of DoMosaics is still experimental.

    <p>
        In a domain graph, domains are displayed as nodes and edges connect domains which co-occur within at least
        one
        protein. Domain graphs can be undirected, where the edges have no direction and hence are indicative only of
        co-occurrences, or directed, where edges have directions indicating the order in which they appear in
        proteins.
        In DoMosaics, domain graphs are directed (from N to C-terminus).

    <h4>Domain Dotplot</h4>

    <hr>

    <p>
        A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_plot_%28bioinformatics%29"> Dotplot </a> is a graphical method
        for
        conducting a pairwise-sequence comparison. By comparing all positions of
        the first sequence to all positions of the second, matches (regions of similarity) of a given length
        can be identified (word-length). Using the two sequences as axes to a rectangular plot, a dot a positioned
        between words from both sequences which are similar.
    </p>

    <p>
        Domain-dotplots are an extension of a regular dotplot. Given two selected domain arrangements <b>with an
        underlying
        sequence attached</b> (recognizable by a rectangular [s] which appears on mouse over on domains in the
        domain-view),
        a standard dotplot of amino-acids is created (with customisable substitution matrix, word length and score).
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/dotplot.png"></p>

    <p>
        Additionally each domain of one protein is facing its corresponding (same domain family) in the other
        protein, and is represented by a square with the indicated average conservation. Hence, this adds to the
        global sequence conservation the information about which domain are the most conserved and, for example in
        case of multiple repeats, which domains are likely paralogs.

    <h4>E-value Resolver</h4>
    <hr>

    <p>
        This tool has been designed to post process domain annotation with loose (not stringent) E-value thresholds.
        It includes 3 filters of domain annotations: an e-value filter, an overlap resolver, and the Co-Occurring
        Domain Detection (CODD) method.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="img/evalue_res.png"></p>

    <p>
        The E-value filter allows a dynamic visualization of domain arrangements of proteins. Starting with a domain
        annotation conducted with very high e-value thresholds, the user can play with the threshold settings
        and see impact on domain arrangements (as opposed iteratively re-annotating with varying thresholds).
    </p>

    <p>
        The overlap resolver allows to clean the domain annotation after a "complete domain annotation process" which
        might contain overlapping domains at the same position. Only one domain occurrence is supposed to be
        present/active at one position of a protein. The usual overlap resolvers is based on E-value, only retaining
        domain occurrences with best e-values and removing overlapping domains incrementally. Additionally we propose a
        resolver that maximize the coverage of the protein by domains. These options are provided to be able to retrieve
        "standard arrangements" from overlapping ones. However, in some cases a user might be interested in keeping
        overlaps as they must not result from erroneous annotation by misleading amino-acid sequences similarities,
        but instead might also involve evolutionary relationships of domains.
        In this later case, one must question which function is actually present, especially when scores and e-values
        are high and significant.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Co-Occurring Domain Detection (CODD) method (Terrapon et al., 2009) has been designed for the
        context-dependent detection of divergent domains in remote species or detecting domains in species which exhibit
        a high amino-acid composition bias. CODD works as a filter on putative domains (domains which do not satisfying defined thresholds)
        by removing the most doubtful domains and retaining the most reliable ones. The filter takes advantage if the known property of
        domain co-occurrence: most domain families are observed in proteins with only few other "favorite" (function
        collaboration/compatibility) domain families. Hence, using a list of correlated domain pairs, CODD can certify
        the presence of putative domains based on the asserted presence of others. This method is able to increase domain
        annotation in case of divergence/bias while rejecting the majority of false putative domains generated
        resulting from the loosening of E-value thresholds.
